Use your good arm to lift the opposite elbow and bring your injured arm across your body, wrapping yourself. Use gentle pressure to stretch your arms criss-cross.</li>
        <li><span>Wall Slides: </span>  You need to stand facing the wall and then place both your palms on the wall, but your thumbs should be facing you. Slide your arms up and down a few times.</li>
</li>
