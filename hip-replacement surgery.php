    <p>Hip replacement surgery, also known as hip arthroplasty, is a common orthopaedic surgery. It improves the quality of life for people suffering from hip pain due to injury, arthritis, or other conditions.</p>
    <p>Today, we will understand more about what is hip replacement surgery​, why it’s recommended, what its types are, and what to expect from it.</p>
    <h4>What Is a Hip Replacement Surgery?</h4>
    <p><span>Hip replacement surgery, </span>or hip arthroplasty, is one of the common surgical procedures where a damaged hip joint is replaced with a new artificial implant. The hip structure has a ball and socket joint. When soft tissue that protects the bones deteriorates, it leads to pain, stiffness, and difficulty in movement.</p>
    <p>During <span>hip arthroplasty</span>, the damaged part of the hip is removed and a man-made joint made from metal, ceramic, or plastic is inserted. The modern prosthetic implants are designed to last for many years.</p>
    <h4>When Is Hip Replacement Surgery Recommended?</h4>
    <p>Hip joint replacement surgery is generally recommended by doctors when other treatments like medication, physiotherapy, or lifestyle changes fail to relieve pain or improve mobility. Here are some indications where doctors might suggest hip replacement surgery​.</p>
    <ul class="surgery-list">
        <li><span>Severe Pain:</span> Unbearable pain that interferes with daily activities like walking, sitting, and standing.</li>
        <li><span>Reduced Motion: </span>Chronic inflammation, stiffness, and joint pain make it difficult to perform daily activities.</li>
        <li><span>Sleeplessness:</span> The severe pain makes it unable to have a sound sleep</li>
        <li><span>Failure of Non-Surgical Treatments:</span> General medications fail to provide relief.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Types of Hip Replacement Surgeries</h5>
    <p>Though different types of hip replacement surgeries are structured to address different types of hip joint damage and patients’ needs, there are two main categories of hip arthroplasty:</p>
    <h6>1. Total Hip Replacement</h6>
    <p>Total hip replacement surgery is a widely performed procedure that replaces both the femoral head (ball) and the acetabulum (socket). This type of hip joint replacement surgery is recommended for patients with severe hip arthritis, joint degeneration, or fractures.</p>
    <h6>2. Partial Hip Replacement</h6>
    <p>Partial hip replacement surgery, also known as hemiarthroplasty, involves replacing only one part of the hip, usually the ball (femoral head). This surgery is typically performed on patients with a hip fracture or when only the ball (femoral head) is damaged and the socket (acetabulum) is healthy.</p>
    <h5>What to Expect?</h5>
    <p>Hip replacement surgery cost​ varies from hospital to hospital. However, other procedures like preparation, stay at the hospital, therapy, and restrictions after hip replacement surgery are almost the same everywhere.</p>
    <h6>Preparation</h6>
    <p>Hip arthroplasty is performed under general anaesthesia. The surgery might take about two hours. Before the surgery, the patient might have to undergo certain tests recommended by their doctors. The patient must follow the instructions and guidance given by their surgeons.</p>
    <h6>Pain</h6>
    <p>After the hip joint replacement surgery, one might experience some pain and discomfort for the first few days. But you will be prescribed medication for pain management.</p>
    <h6>Hospital Stay</h6>
    <p>The patient might have to stay in the hospital for two to four days. However, it depends on the individual’s health, recovery, and potential complications.</p>
    <h6>Physical Therapy</h6>
    <p>Post-surgery, physiotherapy might begin after a day or two. It is important as it helps restore the mobility and strength of the hip</p>
    <h6>Restrictions</h6>
    <p>The patient will be advised to restrict the movements, such as bending or twisting for the first few weeks. But gradually they will be allowed to start the movements.</p>
    <h6>Recovery</h6>
    <p>Hip replacement surgery recovery time varies with the individual health and complications. While most individuals return to normal activities within 3 to 6 months, some take almost a year to recover completely.</p>
    <h5>Risk and Complications</h5>
    <p>Just like any other surgery, hip replacement surgery also holds some risks. Some potential complications include:</p>
    <ul class="surgery-list">
        <li><span>Infection:</span> Infections can happen in the deep tissues around the joints or at the point of surgery. However, antibiotics are given during the surgery to minimise the risk of any infection.</li>
        <li><span>Blood Clot:</span> In general, surgery can increase the risk of blood clots; hence, the patients are given blood thinners and are encouraged to move their legs after surgery.</li>
        <li><span>Implant Wear or Loss:</span> While modern implants are designed to last longer, there are still chances of wear and tear of prosthetic components. In such cases, a revision surgery may be necessary.</li>
        <li><span>Dislocation:</span> Sometimes, the newly fixed hip joint may get dislocated. However, following physiotherapy and restricting certain activities can help to prevent it.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>Hip replacement surgery is an effective option for individuals who are suffering from chronic pain, discomfort, and restricted mobility. Understanding the procedure, recovery process, and potential risks will help you make an informed decision. Lastly, seek your healthcare provider’s help to assess your situation and determine if the surgery is right for you</p>
