    <p>Celiac Disease is an illness stemming from an immune reaction against gluten consumption. Gluten is a substance present in whole grains like barley, wheat, rye and more. A person with Celiac disease is prevented from eating gluten as it triggers an allergic reaction in the small intestine. Over time, if not taken care of, the small intestine lining is damaged.</p>
    <p>One also finds it hard to absorb the nutrients, leading to a state of malabsorption. Hence, it is essential to seek out a professional when symptoms arise.</p>
    <h4>What Is Celiac Disease?</h4>
    <p>Celiac disease is an allergic reaction of the immune system against gluten, which is present in food. This leads to a state where the body finds it hard to absorb essential nutrients, as the small intestine walls are sensitive. Damage to the intestine often leads to a condition like diarrhea or a feeling of bloating. Difficulty in absorption causes serious complications like anemia, weight loss and fatigue. In children, the effects of celiac disease are more prominent as malabsorption of food leads to severe gastrointestinal symptoms.</p>
    <p>Although there is no definite cure for the disease, one can take measures like avoiding foods with celiac disease or seek medication to keep the symptoms under control.</p>
    <h4>Celiac Disease Causes</h4>
    <p>The cause behind one’s reaction to celiac disease can be genetic composition. Other causes include major surgery that can have the aftereffect of developing an allergy to several food items. Moreover, frequent gastrointestinal diseases in kids, gut bacteria in infants, feeding practices, pregnancy, post-childbirth symptoms, and viral infection can be major contributors to triggering celiac disease.</p>
    <p>As the immune system reacts against gluten intake in the body, the tiny hair projections, called villi, are damaged on the walls of the intestine. Individuals with type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disorder, colitis, or a family history of celiac disease are at higher risk of developing the disease.</p>
    <p>If symptoms of celiac disease such as fatigue, digestive issues, or nutrient deficiencies persist for more than two weeks, it’s important to seek medical help. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent long-term complications. Consult the best gastroenterologist in Lucknow to get a proper evaluation and personalized guidance for managing celiac disease effectively.</p>
    <h4>Celiac Disease Symptoms</h4>
    <p>The symptoms of celiac disease in adults and children vary greatly. Here’s a list of celiac disease symptoms to look out for:</p>
    <ul class="surgery-list">
        <li>Extreme fatigue</li>
        <li>Diarrhea</li>
        <li>Weight loss</li>
        <li>Bloating and gas</li>
        <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
        <li>Pain in the abdominal area</li>
        <li>Anemia, due to a lack of iron because of the inefficiency of the small intestine</li>
        <li>Osteoporosis, due to a lack of calcium absorption</li>
        <li>Mouth ulcer</li>
        <li>Joint pain</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Symptoms in kids</h5>
    <p>Wondering what is dyslexia and how to understand the signs? Dyslexia may show up in different stages of severity, which are as follows:</p>
    <ul class="surgery-list">
        <li>Chronic diarrhea</li>
        <li>Vomiting and nausea</li>
        <li>Swollen belly</li>
        <li>Acute constipation</li>
        <li>Pale and foul-smelling faeces</li>
        <li>Gas</li>
        <li>Damage to teeth enamel and bones due to a lack of calcium absorption</li>
        <li>Anemia and weight loss</li>
        <li>Short stature and delayed puberty</li>
        <li>Irritability and neurological disorders</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Celiac Disease Treatments</h4>
    <p>Most of the symptoms are likely to be eradicated with the removal of gluten from your diet. Identifying the signs and opting for celiac disease treatment can help cure the situation before any adverse effects occur. Allow the intestine to heal with mild medications from the doctor, and do not indulge in food items that even have a trace of gluten.</p>
    <p>For instance, in the case of dermatitis herpetiformis, one needs to go for a dose of drugs containing diamino diphenyl sulfone or Dapsone to cure the rashes and blisters on the skin surface. However, these drugs are effective for external manifestations on the skin and cannot cure the intestinal wall. For that, you need to switch to a gluten-free diet.</p>
    <p>Vitamins and mineral supplements are often recommended to a person with celiac disease to compensate for the lack of nutrients in the body due to malabsorption. Research is being conducted on drugs for celiac disease to find long-term relief.</p>
   
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>Celiac disease is manageable with early diagnosis and a strict gluten-free diet. If symptoms persist, consult a specialist to prevent long-term health issues. Timely care can make all the difference.</p>
