    <p>Have you ever felt your heart racing or skipping a beat, even when you’re at rest? These irregularities, known as arrhythmias, occur when your heart’s rhythm isn’t functioning as it should.</p>
    <p>Arrhythmias can range from harmless episodes lasting just a few moments to serious conditions requiring immediate attention. Some may come with noticeable symptoms, while others go unnoticed. The impact and prognosis often depend on the individual and the underlying cause.</p>
    <h4>What is Arrhythmia?</h4>
    <p>Cardiac arrhythmia, or abnormal heartbeat, is a condition that can start from any part of the heart. It could radiate too fast, too slow or irregular sensations.</p>
    <p>Under normal conditions, your heart beats in a synchronised manner. Issues in various parts of your heart or blood matters circulating to it can trigger several heart arrhythmia symptoms. Having a normal heartbeat matters as your heart is your vital organ supplying oxygenated blood to your body.</p>
    <h4>Is Cardiac Arrhythmia Serious?</h4>
    <p>Some cardiac arrhythmia types are harmless and do not require much medical intervention. Others with evidently persistent symptoms may put you in cardiac arrest.</p>

    <h5>Supraventricular arrhythmia</h5>
    <p>This begins in the atria of your heart. The word ‘supraventricular’ indicates above your ventricles.</p>
    <h5>Bradyarrhythmia</h5>
    <p>Bradyarrhythmia or junctional rhythms happen when your heart conduction system shows abnormality.</p>
    <h4>Is Arrhythmia a Common Scenario?</h4>
    <p>Many people suffer from arrhythmia. However, not every individual exhibits symptoms. Nor are they the same in all individuals. It thus becomes difficult to estimate the exact counts of individuals dealing with this medical condition.</p>
