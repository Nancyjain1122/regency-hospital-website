           <h1>Echocardiograms</h1>
           <h6>An echocardiogram is a vital and widely used diagnostic test that employs high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound) to create real-time images of the heart.</h6>

    <div class="echoo-div">
        <p>An Echo also known as Echocardiograms is a test that uses sound waves to produce detailed images of the heart’s valves, size, structure and function. It also can show blood flow through the heart and heart valves.</p>
        <p>Echo is done to look for heart problems. The test shows how blood moves through the heart chambers and heart valves. Your health care provider may order this test if you have chest pain or shortness of breath.</p>
        <p>Cardiologist at Shreya Hospital use the pictures from the Echo to find heart disease and other heart conditions. They use the results of these tests and a clinical evaluation to offer medical care and lifestyle counseling tailored to you.</p>
        <p>Other names for this test are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Heart ultrasound.</li>
            <li>Heart sonogram.</li>

    <h3>Types of Echocardiograms</h3>
    <p>There are different types of echocardiograms. The type you have depends on the information your health care provider needs.</p>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Transthoracic echocardiogram, also called a TTE -</strong> This is a standard echocardiogram. It’s also called a heart ultrasound. It’s a noninvasive way to look at blood flow through the heart and heart valves. A TTE creates pictures of the heart from outside the body. Dye, called contrast, may be given by IV. It helps the heart’s structures show up better on the images.</li>
        <li><strong>Transesophageal echocardiogram, also called a TEE - </strong> If a standard echocardiogram doesn’t provide as many details as needed, your provider may do this test. It gives a detailed look at the heart and the body’s main artery, called the aorta. A TEE creates pictures of the heart from inside the body. It’s often done to examine the aortic valve. This test shouldn’t be done if you have bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract or a tumor or tear in the esophagus.</li>
        <li><strong>Fetal echocardiogram - </strong> This type of echocardiogram is done during pregnancy to check the baby’s heart. It’s a noninvasive test that involves moving an ultrasound wand over the pregnant person’s belly. It lets a health care provider see the unborn baby’s heart without using surgery or X-rays.</li>
        <li><strong>Stress echocardiogram - </strong>A stress echocardiogram is done right before and after you exercise at a medical office. It checks how the heart responds to physical activity or stress. Your health care provider may order this test if they think you have coronary artery disease. If you can’t exercise, you may be given medicine to make your heart work harder.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Echocardiogram methods</h3>
    <p>There are several methods to an echocardiogram. They include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) echocardiogram - </strong> These images provide pictures of the heart walls and valves and of the large vessels connected to your heart. A standard echocardiogram begins with a 2D study of the heart. A 3D echocardiogram is available in some medical centers and hospitals. It’s often done to get more details about the lower left heart chamber. This chamber is the heart’s main pumping area.</li>
        <li><strong>Doppler echocardiogram - </strong> Sound waves change pitch when they bounce off blood cells moving through the heart and blood vessels. These changes are called Doppler signals. This part of the test measures the speed and direction of blood flow within the heart and vessels. It can help show blocked or leaking valves and check blood pressure in the heart arteries</li>
        <li><strong>Color flow imaging - </strong>  This displays the blood flow in the heart in color. It helps identify leaky heart valves and other changes in blood flow.
</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Is an Echocardiogram Important?</h3>
    <p>An echocardiogram helps detect various heart conditions, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Heart valve problems:</strong> including valve narrowing (stenosis), leakage (regurgitation), or valve prolapse.</li>
        <li><strong>Heart failure:</strong> Identifying heart function problems and monitoring treatment progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Congenital heart defects:</strong> Detecting issues like holes in the heart walls (septal defects) or abnormal heart vessels.</li>
        <li><strong>Pericardial disease:</strong> Detecting fluid accumulation around the heart or other issues in the pericardium (the lining around the heart).</li>
        <li><strong>Aneurysms:</strong> An echocardiogram can help detect weakened, bulging sections of arteries or heart walls.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Prepare for an Echocardiogram</h3>
    <p>Generally, there are no major preparations required for an echocardiogram, but here are a few guidelines:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Wear comfortable clothing:</strong> You may be asked to wear a hospital gown during the procedure.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid certain foods or drinks:</strong> For specific types of echocardiograms like stress tests, fasting or avoiding caffeine may be required.</li>
        <li><strong>Bring your medical history:</strong> Have details of your health history and any medications you are taking. This will help the technician and physician assess the results more accurately.</li>
        <li><strong>Discuss medications:</strong> If you are on medication for heart conditions or have any allergies, be sure to let the provider know.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="echo-expect">
    <h3>What to Expect During the Procedure</h3>
    <p>An echocardiogram is a simple and noninvasive procedure. Here’s what typically happens during the test:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> You’ll be asked to lie down on an exam table, and the technician will apply a gel to your chest to help the sound waves travel better.</li>
        <li><strong>Probe placement:</strong> The technician will move a small probe (called a transducer) over your chest area. The probe emits sound waves that bounce off the heart and return to create images.</li>
        <li><strong>Duration:</strong> The test typically takes between 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the type of echo being done.</li>
        <li><strong>Post-procedure:</strong> There are no side effects. You can resume normal activities right after the test.</li>
    </ul>
