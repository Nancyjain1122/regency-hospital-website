    <p>Sciatica occurs when you experience a sense of irritation, inflammation, or compressing effect in your lower back nerve. Though it is not a life-dangering situation, the pain can be worse. Most people feel better over time under professional guidance and treatments. However, severe cases might be an alarm for surgical correction.</p>
    <p>If you’re dealing with sciatica pain, understanding its causes and treatment options is key to managing it effectively. From identifying early signs to exploring non-surgical remedies, knowing your options can empower you to make informed decisions.</p>
    <h4>What is Sciatica?</h4>
    <p>Sciatica is a medical condition where you experience a painful nerve. Irritation or injury to the nerve could be one of the probable reasons behind it. In addition to pain, it could also result in numbing and tingling sensation all over your lower back and butt. In extreme cases, it is seen as trembling down the legs.</p>
    <p>The sciatic nerve is the longest and thickest nerve in the body. Measuring around 2 cm, it is not just a single long nerve but a cluster of nerves radiating from five neural roots branching off your main spinal cord.</p>
    <p>The initial stages of sciatica may cause mild to moderately painful symptoms. However, gradually, the pain is passed down to your lower back, to your hips, to your buttocks, and finally terminated in your lower legs.</p>
    <h4>Types of Sciatica Pain</h4>
    <p>Sciatica pain is mainly divided into two categories. However, the effects remain the same regardless of what you are dealing with.</p>
    <ul class="surgery-list">
        <li><span>True Sciatica:</span> This is an injurious condition directly impacting your sciatic nerve.</li>
        <li><span>Sciatica-like conditions:</span> These may give you the same symptoms as those of true sciatica. However, the underlying cause is different.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Sciatica Symptoms You Should Worry About</h5>
    <p>The sciatica symptoms include:</p>
    <h5>Pain</h5>
    <p>Sciatica pain is the after-effect of the compression felt by your sciatica nerve. Most people experiencing this pain describe it as an electric shock or burning sensation. It shoots or radiates down your legs.</p>
    <h5>Tingling sensation</h5>
    <p>Prevalent as sharp pins and needles pain, tingling sensation is another common sciatica symptom. You experience this sensation when one of your legs falls asleep following a cross-legged sitting posture.</p>
    <h5>Numbness</h5>
    <p>The condition when you do not feel the touch on your affected skin is called numbness. It happens when your leg or back has trouble communicating with your brain.</p>
    <h5>Weakness in the Muscles</h5>
    <p> Muscle weakness is a severe sciatica symptom. It means that your muscles command signals from your brain and find it difficult to reach your legs.</p>
    <h4>What are the Probable Causes of Sciatica?</h4>
    <p>Conditions that are likely to cause you sciatica pain include:</p>
    <ul class="surgery-list">
        <li>Herniated discs</li>
