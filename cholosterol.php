    <p>When talking about cholesterol, the first things that pop into our minds are heart attack and stroke! Because of this, cholesterol has always been in the bad light. However, we often ignore the fact that not all cholesterols. There is both good and bad cholesterol in our bodies that work differently.</p>
    <p>Here, we will learn about the difference between good and bad cholesterol and how to balance them.</p>
    <h4>What is Cholesterol?</h4>
    <p>Cholesterol is a fat-like, waxy substance in the blood and all the cells in the body. It is produced in the liver and transported through the bloodstream by the fat-protein combination known as lipoprotein. Lipoproteins are of two types: low-density lipoprotein (LDL), also known as bad cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein HDL, known as good cholesterol. Let’s find out what is good cholesterol and bad cholesterol​ in detail.</p>
    <h4>Good Cholesterol</h4>
    <p>Also known as high-density lipoprotein (HDL), good cholesterol acts as a garbage collector. It carries excessive fat from the bloodstream and transfers it to the liver, where it is processed and excreted. HDL helps reduce the build-up of plaque in the arteries that leads to heart attacks or strokes. Its anti-inflammatory properties keep cardiovascular disease at bay.</p>
<h6>Ideal levels:</h6>
<p>For men, below 40 mg/dL is considered low and above 60 mg/dL is considered as good.</p>
<p>For women, below 50 mg/dL is known as low and above 60 mg/dL is considered desirable.</p>
    <h4>Bad Cholesterol</h4>
    <p>Bad cholesterol, also known as low-density lipoprotein (LDL), carries cholesterol from the liver to the body cells, performing various functions. This is good in ideal conditions, however, too much LDL in the body contributes to the formation of plaque in the arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke and peripheral artery disease. High levels of LDL can also cause blood clots increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.</p>
    <h6>Ideal Levels:</h6>
    <ul class="surgery-list">
        <li>Less than 100 mg/dL is considered ideal.</li>
        <li>A reading between 130 and 159 mg/dL falls within the borderline high range.</li>
        <li>Above 160 to 189 mg/dL is high.</li>
        <li>Above 190 mg/dL is very high.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>How to Balance Cholesterol Levels?</h4>
    <p>Now that you know about cholesterol, let’s check out how to increase good cholesterol​ through simple changes in our lifestyle and how to lower bad cholesterol​ for a healthy life.</p>
    <h6>Diet</h6>
    <p>Eating heart-healthy foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids like fish, nuts, and seeds helps increase HDL while reducing LDL. Food rich in soluble fibre such as whole grains, cereals, lentils and legumes, fruits and vegetables.</p>
    <p>To balance good and bad cholesterol it is essential to eat healthy foods and limit unhealthy ones. Avoid fried food, bakery items, margarine, sugary snacks and other processed foods as they contain trans fat which increases the level of LDL.</p>
    <h6>Active Lifestyle</h6>
    <p>Being physically active is one of the major factors contributing to a healthy life. Leading an active lifestyle with regular exercise is one of the most effective ways to boost HDL. Activities like walking, running, swimming, cycling or aerobics can help balance good and bad cholesterol.</p>
    <h6>Maintain a Healthy Weight</h6>
    <p>Maintaining a healthy weight is also essential. Being overweight or obese can increase the risk of elevated LDL and lead to health complications. Thus, maintaining an ideal weight through a good diet and an active lifestyle will help stabilise both good and bad cholesterol.</p>
    <h6>Quit Smoking and Limit Alcohol</h6>
    <p>Smoking has been associated with lower HDL and damaging blood vessels. This increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and other heart diseases. While quitting smoking can improve HDL levels and overall heart health.</p>
    <p>Excessive indulgence in alcohol can also negatively impact the balance of good cholesterol and bad cholesterol. Thus, limiting alcohol intake can support healthy cholesterol levels.</p>
    <h6>Start Meditation</h6>
    <p>Sometimes, dietary and lifestyle changes may not be enough and your body might require that extra push. Therefore, practising meditation can contribute to overall well-being.</p>
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>Cholesterol is an essential body factor that is responsible for various physiological functions. Maintaining a healthy balance between good cholesterol and bad cholesterol is an inevitable thing to maintain a healthy heart. Having the right diet, active lifestyle, maintaining a healthy weight, quitting smoking and limiting alcohol are key strategies to maintain good cholesterol and bad cholesterol. Understanding the difference between good and bad cholesterol​ can significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and improve heart health.</p>
