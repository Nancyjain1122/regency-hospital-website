        <p>I came to Regency Hospital, Kanpur for the treatment of my liver condition. We learned about Regency through friends in my workplace. The team at Regency provided me with top-notch service and personalized attention, much more than I expected. The staff is very helpful and cooperative. I already have and will surely recommend this remarkable health institution to my family and friends in the future</p>

        <p>I had terrible pelvic pain from the last 6-7 months, and that’s when I was diagnosed with ovarian cysts. Thinking and reading about the cysts made me horrified, but I wanted to cure myself as soon as possible. My aunt, being a doctor herself, recommended Regency Hospital for the treatment of my cysts, and I went ahead with her opinion. From one month, I have been regular with my periods, I have no pelvic pain and I have gotten rid of the cysts. Thanks, Regency!</p>

        <p> I was very apprehensive about being diagnosed with painful stones in my kidney. I was afraid of undergoing surgery. After, meeting with renal specialists at Regency, I found out that every stone does not require an operation. With modern techniques of ESWL (Lithotripsy) PCNL & URS, which are non-invasive, I finally got rid of the stones for all times.</p>

        <p>My partner and I visited the Regency City Clinic in Kanpur following several failed fertility treatments at an earlier fertility clinic for high oestrogen levels. The staff members were very professional and empathetic. The preliminary visit resulted in a gynaecological test, that led to the early diagnosis of a mild ovarian dermoid cyst. Following the removal of the cyst, we were successful in our first IVF trial. I have been blessed with a baby boy 2 months ago. Thank you, Regency!</p>

    What is Anaesthesia? Who provides it?
        <span class="faq-toggle">▼</span>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
     Anaesthesia is given to patients so that surgery and other medical procedures can be carried out safely and without pain. The word anaesthesia means ‘loss of sensation’. People under anaesthesia will ‘lose’ feelings of pain and other sensations.
     <br>
     <br>
    It can be relatively simple, like numbing an area around a tooth during dental treatment, or something more complex, like using powerful drugs to cause unconsciousness.
    <br><br>An Anaesthetist administers your anaesthesia.
