            <hr class="hr-special">

                <p>Appendecotomy is performed to remove the appendix when it becomes infected and may be causing inflammation.</p>

            <img src="image/bladder.webp" alt=""><span class='spannn'>Gallbladder disease</span>
                 <p>Majority of gallbladder diseases happen due to irritation of the gallbladder walls which is mainly caused because of gallstones blocking the duct leading to small intestines. With a simple procedure of cholecystectomy the problem can easily be removed.</p>

            <img src="image/gerd.webp" alt=""><span class='spannn'>GERD & hernia </span>
                <p>With the help of a simple surgery called the fundoplication, our qualified team of doctors and surgeons fix the hernia, if there is one, and wrap the top of the stomach around the bottom of the esophagus that strengthens the sphincter and keeps the acid out.</p>
