        <p>I came to Regency Hospital, Kanpur for the treatment of my liver condition. We learned about Regency through friends in my workplace. The team at Regency provided me with top-notch service and personalized attention, much more than I expected. The staff is very helpful and cooperative. I already have and will surely recommend this remarkable health institution to my family and friends in the future</p>

        <p>I had terrible pelvic pain from the last 6-7 months, and that’s when I was diagnosed with ovarian cysts. Thinking and reading about the cysts made me horrified, but I wanted to cure myself as soon as possible. My aunt, being a doctor herself, recommended Regency Hospital for the treatment of my cysts, and I went ahead with her opinion. From one month, I have been regular with my periods, I have no pelvic pain and I have gotten rid of the cysts. Thanks, Regency!</p>

        <p> I was very apprehensive about being diagnosed with painful stones in my kidney. I was afraid of undergoing surgery. After, meeting with renal specialists at Regency, I found out that every stone does not require an operation. With modern techniques of ESWL (Lithotripsy) PCNL & URS, which are non-invasive, I finally got rid of the stones for all times.</p>

        <p>My partner and I visited the Regency City Clinic in Kanpur following several failed fertility treatments at an earlier fertility clinic for high oestrogen levels. The staff members were very professional and empathetic. The preliminary visit resulted in a gynaecological test, that led to the early diagnosis of a mild ovarian dermoid cyst. Following the removal of the cyst, we were successful in our first IVF trial. I have been blessed with a baby boy 2 months ago. Thank you, Regency!</p>

        <span class="faq-toggle">▼</span>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-question">
      When should you go for GI Surgery?
        <span class="faq-toggle">▼</span>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
    GI surgery is advised when other non-surgical alternatives fail to manage digestive problems associated with a high risk of developing complications such as cancer and chronic gastritis and massive gastrointestinal haemorrhage. If pain, bloating or disturbances in or any similar symptoms last longer than they should, then consult Regency Healthcare’s gastro surgeon in Lucknow and Kanpur.

     How long does GI surgery take?
        <span class="faq-toggle">▼</span>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
      The time taken for GI surgery depends on the complexity of the patient. For example, a routine laparoscopic surgery will take about 1-2 hours, and a complex open surgery may take 4-6 hours. Remember to discuss the time of surgery with the surgeon for the specific case.

      <div class="faq-answer">
      Widespread examples of GI procedures are cholecystectomy, appendectomy, hernia repair, colon resection, and bariatric surgery. Each treatment is determined by the course of the disease as well as the state of health of the patient and all of them aim at resolving the gastrointestinal problem.

      What are some of the benefits of Laparoscopic Surgery over Open Surgery?
        <span class="faq-toggle">▼</span>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
   The benefits of laparoscopic procedures include smaller incision sizes, less pain, less hospital stay, quick recovery time, and reduced chances of infection. Such a surgical technique is usually used for most gastrointestinal operations, as it allows performing the necessary actions with high precision and a low level of injury to the body.
